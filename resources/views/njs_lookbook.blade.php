            It’s Never Avant-Garde Who said a vibrant traditional wear can not combine with a simple and casual wear,
            boots, Goth black lip tint and pronounce the desired statement. I paired a vibrant Banarasi Silk Saree with
            a casual white shirt, a pair of suede boots, black lip tint, a pair of traditional Gold earrings and a
            proper hair bun, stating my desired statement of showing an unorthodox miss match can look absolutely
            fabulous and stunningly gorgeous as well.

        <h3>EXTRAVAGANZA</h3>
        <p class="mb0">
            Elegance is not something you can replace. People will stare, make it worth their while. Fashion is the most
            powerful art there is. It’s a movement, design and architecture, all blended into one breath-taking concept.
            A girl or a woman should be two things; classy and fabulous. I feel prettier with a naked face and a chap
            stick on my lips, but good haircut is what makes the biggest difference. It’s because it creates a personal
            style and the personal style is attitude which is attractive compared as its coming from within.

            In The Trees, In the Breeze; Natures Peace And Bliss; Nature always wears the colour of the spirit. Our very
            Being, Essence, Health and Happiness depends on Mother Earth and Nature. The nature has its own music for
            those who will listen. To sit under the sun on a fine day and look upon the Lush Green and Greek God Rhea’s
            Blue Sky is the perfect refreshment. No wonder photography is called the love affair with nature.

        <h3>NAUTICAL STRIP GAME IS ON</h3>
        <p class="mb0">
            Never underestimate the power of stripped outfit they said, It’s not just a way of dressing up, it’s a
            serious love affair with the strips. Stripped outfits just doesn’t pull the most elegant and formal looks
            but it’s a whole different ball game in terms of looking fabulously gorgeous for any occasion too. I wore
            this swaying gorgeous stripped tuxedo from H&M to prove the statement; “ you wear a stripped tux and attend
            a party; it’s absolutely impossible for people not to take you seriously as the strips make sure that you
            have made the statement and your presence felt in the crowd.”

        <h3>ONE TOUCH OF NATURE MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD KIN</h3>
        <p class="mb0">
            Look deep into the nature, then only you’ll understand everything much better. Nature always wears the color
            of spirit. In every walk with nature, one receives far more than what he seeks. To sit in the shade in a
            sunny day and look upon the verdant green serenity is the most perfect refreshment one can ask for.I go to
            the nature to be soothed and healed and to have my life put in order of purity and divineness.

        <h3>THE RETRO RED</h3>
        <p class="mb0">
            A woman’s dress should be like a barbed wire fence; serving its purpose without obstructing the view. When
            in doubt wear red. Because red is the single most dynamic and passionate color that symbolizes love, rage
            and courage, demanding attention, I combined a bold red party ware with stockings and black stilettos to
            make a statement that pronounces “believe in yourself so strongly that the world can’t help but believe in
            you. The most beautiful thing that you can wear is confidence.”

        <h3>BRUNCH AT BAE’S PLACE</h3>
        <p class="mb0">
            Dress like you’re going somehow better later on. The secret of great style is to feel good and confident in
            what you wear.
            So the other day, I went to a very casual brunch gathering at my friend’s place, I pulled a bit of dressed
            up look for the occasion.
            Though it was a brunch at one of my friend’s place, I wanted and preferred being dressed up since I didn’t
            want to look overly cozy and comfortable. That’s because it’s letting the whole crowd know and feel your
            worth and your presence had already been made, rather than being utterly cozy and comfortable that no one
            notices your presence. It’s because what you wear is how you present yourself to the surrounding you’re in.

        <h3>CHOCKER AND COLD SHOULDER IS A NEW LOVE AFFAIR</h3>

            I can and I will. I see bold accessories as a woman’s armor. I say, dress to please yourself. Listen to the
            inner muse and take a chance, wear something today that says “Here I Am !“
            I wore the chocker necklace accompanying the cold shoulder top, a very pronouncing outfit, making or proving
            the statement “SHE BELIEVED, SHE COULD; SO SHE DID”. I can not think of any better representation of fashion
            and beauty than someone not being afraid of being herself.

        <h3>CASUAL EVENING DATE WITH FLORAL MOTIF</h3>
        <p class="mb0">
            What you wear is how you present yourself to the world.
            Fashion speaks for itself, fashion is an instant language.
            Dresses doesn’t always necessarily be outlandishly lavish and expensive to look fabulous and flawless. The
            same fabulous and flawless look can equally be pulled off, in a very minimized price point, if you have the
            proper taste and idea.
            I combined this gorgeous and beautiful floral gown from Forever 21, with the pair of sexy stilettos by Zara
            to pronounce my view.

        <h3>BLACK AND GOLD MUSING</h3>
        <p class="mb0">
            A rebel with a soul in a black armour. She had a heart of gold. Stepping out of the conventional idea that
            only zero figured girls can pull the Bodycon Dress .I wanted to make this statement visible that anyone can
            pull a glamorous look in the winter wearing a Bodycon Dress, without adding a few extra layers over it.
            Thus I went for the Black Woolen Bodycon Dress by Zara, combining it with a Bold Statement Gold Belt and a
            pair of Latex High Shafted Boots by H&M, to a party in the winter’s peak.
